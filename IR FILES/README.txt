The heater file is for portable heaters, i have other demonstrations of this working however it is not universal, specific stand up heaters only.
Xbox - literally turns on and off xbox ones, including in store such as walmart etc display consoles (not my work just uploaded as alot of people request it)
TV1 is for RCA tvs programmed to turn them all on and off, just easier to turn on and off multiple at once with this script, ALL working as of jan 23'
